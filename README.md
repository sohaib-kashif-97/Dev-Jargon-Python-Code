# Python Developer Beginner Jargon Examples
Welcome to the Python Developer Beginner Jargon Examples repository! This collection of Python code snippets and mini-projects is designed to accompany a Medium article aimed at demystifying common low-level developer terms for newcomers to Python development.

## About this Repository
Starting your first Python developer job can introduce you to many new concepts and terminology. This repo provides hands-on Python examples to explain key jargon from the following topics:

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
Examples demonstrating classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### Making and Importing Python Modules
Simple modules created and imported across files to emphasize code organization and reuse.

### Lambda Functions
Concise examples using anonymous functions for inline operations like sorting and filtering.

### YAML Configuration File
Parsing YAML configuration files in Python for flexible, human-readable configuration management.

### Virtual Environments
Instructions and best practices for creating isolated Python environments using venv.

### Terminal Arguments
Scripts that accept and process command-line arguments, demonstrating dynamic input handling.

### How to Use
Each folder or Python file in this repository corresponds to one of the above topics. Run and experiment with the examples to strengthen your understanding and prepare yourself for your first Python developer role.

### Medium Article Link
A detailed article explaining these concepts alongside code explanations will be linked here soon.
